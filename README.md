# Module 7.2: Testing The Hello World Exercise

**Writing tests before you code** will enable you to **think through the goals** of **your code** and **validate** that it **works**. In this video, you will learn about the **test driven development workflow**, which will help you **refine your code**. To complete the **Hello World Exercise**, ```fork``` the **starter code** from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kogsio/greeting). Follow along with this video to **set this up** on your **local machine** and to **begin testing** with ```npm.```

Testing software, given its complexity, has been part of creating software for a very long time, well over 40 years. And as you start to write code and your code grows, keeping a handle on what's taking place, keeping some certainty about what's happening within your code is something that you want to have. Because of it, testing suites and testing ecosystems have emerged around the practice of building software. And one of the approaches is to write your software even before you start to write your code; it gives you some sense of where you're going. It gives you some feedback even before you start writing your code.
