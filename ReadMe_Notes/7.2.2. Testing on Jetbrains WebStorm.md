## II. Troubleshooting in WebStorm:

Need to use run button, doesn't work for some reason on terminal. But need to configure first as shown below.

Run ```npm install``` first.

Then run the following command ```npm test``` in the ```terminal``` but got the following error message. After spending 3 hours figuring out the only solution was to create a run config and run the test through the "green run button" and configuring it as shown above.

What fixed the ```error: 'no ts-node'``` error message after running the pre config commands above was running this command in the ```terminal```.

```shell
npm install ts-node
```

as seen below
